# What is BSides?

BSides events combine security expertise from a variety of platforms in search of the “next big thing” in information security.  BSides is an open platform that gives security experts and industry professionals the opportunity to share ideas, insights, and develop longstanding relationships with others in the community.  It is a rare opportunity to directly connect and create trusted relationships with key members of the community.

BSides began in 2009 when talented speakers were unable to present at a major conference due to limited space and time. In response, BSides was created to expand opportunities, allowing more speakers, diverse topics, and innovative events to thrive beyond conventional conference limitations.

The goal of BSides is to offer small intimate events where all participants can engage each other to help develop connections, friendships, and network with different industry professionals.

## Team

The BSides Groningen team will handle all event logistics and coordination to deliver a seamless and memorable experience for attendees, speakers, and sponsors.
