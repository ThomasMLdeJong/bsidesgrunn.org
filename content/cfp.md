- Based on the ratings from our CFP review board, the submissions with the highest score are put into our first round of acceptance notices.
- We allow ~1 week for these submitters to respond. If we can not get a hold of, or hear back from, said submitter(s) then we move down our acceptance list. Additionally, circumstances may arise which prevent a submitter from being able or willing to present at our conference. If this occurs, we must once again continue down the acceptance list.

### Accepted Speakers

- Additionally, we will be posting the speaker list and talk abstracts so please let us know if anything changed (title, abstract, etc.).
- If you would like to have someone come to the conference with you, please just send us their information so we can register them.
